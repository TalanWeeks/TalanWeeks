### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Talan Weeks. Currently I'm a student at Boise CodeWorks, but I aim to be a software developer in the near future. I have an associates in Mechatronics and a diverse background in automation and telecommunication. I love using logic to solve problems or puzzles and finding out why things work the way they do or how we could make them better. My main draw towards software development is its endless opportunities in both learning and lifestyle.
