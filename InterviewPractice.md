Elevator Pitch

It's nice to meet you and thank you talking time to interview with me today.
I'm a Boise native with passion of software development. I acquired my associates degree in Mechatronics at College of Western Idaho.
I started my journey into technology as a robotic automation specialist. From there I went into the field of telecommunications,
but I inevitably found myself wanting to get back into programming. Based off research and recommendations I decided to attend BoiseCodeWorks to become a full stack
software developer. I learned core web development skills and languages as well as made a ton of great connections. The Technologies I learned there include: 
Node.js, mongoDb, C#, .Net, MySQL, RESTfull APIs and much more. Learning new technologies and skills is a major passion of mine. 
This was one of the main reasons I perused working for (The company I’m interviewing for). In my research I discovered that (The company I’m interviewing for)
truly cares about continual education and advancement into other aspects of the field.

FIVE STAR QUESTIONS
1. Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
Situation: When I was working in telecommunications I went to a house for a standard repair, but when I arrived at the house, 
I was met by a furious customer who was swearing and yelling at me almost instantly about a situation that I didn’t know about.
Task: I needed to calm the customer down and diffuse the situation so that I could analyze what had happened and what needed to be done to resolve the situation 
and get this customers service back up.
Action: To calm the customer down I assured them that I was not the last tech who came out and that I would 
do my personal best to resolve the situation or get it to engineering who could help them with their situation. 
I also told them that they can walk with me while I work and I can explain the process to them, or if they didn’t want to do that,
I would inform them at every major point of the repair of what I was doing and what needed to be done next.
Resolution: After properly assessing the situation I was able to get the customers line repaired temporarily so that they had service that day.
I also filled out the required forms to get engineering out to fix the damaged line permanently. 
Doing this not only calmed the customer down but brought their faith back into the company.

2. Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
Situation: When I was working in the robotic automation field, I was tasked with travelling to Tennessee to finish the sell and implementation
of a robotic cell we had made. This was the first time I had been on my own in this situation.
Task: The unwritten part of this sell was that we needed to complete x number of products with this robot in that week I was there.
This added immense pressure to the job because not only did I have to code it and implement it we essentially had to run production at the same time.
Action: Everyday I had to break down the tasks we needed to accomplish based off the product we needed to run that day. 
This caused me to try and be as fluid as possible while keeping the end goal in mind.
Resolution: I was able to accomplish the task and sell the robot by the end of week by sticking to the strict plan and doing what I could when I could do it. 

3. Tell me about a time you set a goal for yourself. How did you go about ensuring that you would meet your objective?
Situation: When I decided to go to BoiseCodeWorks for web development I had to figure out how and when I could go to the school. 
I knew I wanted to devote myself entirely to the schooling, so I didn’t want to have to work while I went through it. 
I also wanted to come into the program with a solid understanding of the basics of web development.
Task: I needed to have the money required to pay bills and live semi comfortably. I also needed a basic understanding of the 
basics before attending the school so that I could build off of those and not struggle with the start.
Action: To do this, I wrote out a 3-month plan of all the things I would do to be fully prepared for school. 
I then broke my plan down week by week of tasks I needed to achieve to stay on track. 
Resolution: By following my plan both as a whole and weekly I was able to come up with the money I needed to allow me to 
quit my current job and peruse my future with no distractions. I also had developed a solid understanding of the basic which 
allowed me to progress easily and keep up with the rapid pace of the course.

4. Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way at work.
Situation: I was working closely with my senior robotic programmer on a workcell. My senior tended to get obsessed with certain 
tasks we needed the robot to accomplish. This was a long night, and we were approaching hour 11 of work. He had spent over 
3 hours trying to resolve a specific robotic task and was not very open to help on it. 
Task: I needed to figure out a way to help him or at least look at it without stepping on toes or irritating my senior. 
In the end we were both there trying to get the same goal accomplished.
Action: I asked him if he wanted to take a break and relax for a little while I tried to look at it and attempt the task. 
I assumed him that sometimes things just need a fresh pair of eyes to see the solution. Once he left the room, 
I was able to think about it on my own and I actually got the operation working. Once I tested it a couple of times, 
I brought him back into the room from his break and showed him that I was able to get the task done. 
Resolution: Not only did I show him the task was complete I also was able to explain my thought process on why I attempted it the way I did.
In the end we went with my method, and we were able to call it a night and start fresh the next morning.

5. Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment.
Situation: When I worked in robotics two of us were tasked with building an entire robotic work cell. Not only was it a full cell, 
but it was doing something that the company was told would be impossible to do by other robotic companies. We were tasked with programming, 
wiring, and constructing the tooling of the robot.
Task: I was tasked with the implementation and design of the tooling the robot would use to handle the object it was working with.
Action: I started first by gather all the specific dimensions and details of the objects the robot needed to handle. I then started 
designing prototypes of the tooling. I did this by 3D rendering the tooling based off the dimensions I had gathered. Once I felt comfortable 
I would 3D print the tooling and test it in the physical world. 
Resolution: It was a long process of modification and testing, but in the end, I was able to create three separate end of arm tooling that 
worked perfectly for the tasks needed to be done. This was and is the first tooling of its kind and is one of my prouder moments in my technological career.

INTERVIEW PRACTICE
I plan on doing company research before interviews in multiple aspects. 
I want to know how the general culture is there and the major values that they hold close in the company. 
I also would do research into the technical side of the company/ specific role. 
I plan on know what the company does in general and what this specific role does. 
I also would want to see what technologies/ languages they expect the role I’m applying to. 
If I did this research ahead of time, I think I would interview very well. 
I also plan on practicing some of these common interview questions, so I don’t have to think too hard on examples to use. 
Ideally Ill have a handful of examples that I can use for multiple different questions.

QUESTIONS TO ASK THE INTERVIEWER
What does the career path for someone in this role look like?
What are the characteristics of someone who would succeed in this role?
What do you like best about working here?
What challenges has this company faced in the last few years? What challenges do you anticipate in the coming years?
How would you describe the company culture?

WHITE BOARD CHALLENGES (with Nick)
Nick and I practiced white board challenges together. In comparison to some of the first white board challenges I did much better. 
I now understand that it’s not as much answering the questions as it is explaining your thought process. 
Granted, I have gotten much better at coding, so the challenge wasn’t as hard to work through. Some of my basic practices
I’ve tried to implement are always creating an end variable to hold my result then reiterating the question back to the interviewer.
I tried to remember to not just show my back to the interviewer as I tackle the problem, but to stay half turned to them and explain 
everything that I am writing on the board. The things I could do better is staying calm and not saying things that are irrelevant to “by time while I think”.
I am bad about thinking on the spot under pressure at time my mind will go blank and then I’ll start sounding very dumb.
Since I was with Nick and feel comfortable with him this wasn’t as big of a deal, but I know managing my nerves and pace will
be very important when doing the real thing.
